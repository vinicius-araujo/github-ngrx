## Live demo

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/31f5a27b-5ec0-493c-88e6-7b4e62fcbf6a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/vinicius-araujo-github-ngrx/deploys)

## Motivation

When I first start using NgRx was not that easy to find a small and complete sample. Here you'll find a sample of Angular app using NgRx and Github API, including best practices, testing and a modern CSS.

## Features

- ✔️ Angular 9
- ✔️ NgRx
- ✔️ Modern Layout.
- 🚧 NgRx-router
- 🚧 Testing

## How to install?

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.2.

1 - We are using [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/), so please make sure you have Node installed.

2 - We are using [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) - You can install the CLI globally using `npm install -g @angular/cli`;

3 - Run `npm install` to install all dependencies and start coding 🤘🏻

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
